Hey there! I'm Pranav Bhatkar, a tech enthusiast from Amravati, Maharashtra, and currently a BCA student. ðŸŽ“ After taking a break from college, I jumped into the tech world, working as a Full Stack Developer at PPS Energy Solutions and Axentia. I started as an office assistant and now manage several interesting projects. ðŸ’»

Iâ€™ve created an office management system for tracking attendance and leaves, built Krag, an e-commerce site for SMPS and chargers, and developed an automated report generator with Next.js, Nest.js, and FastAPI for PPS Energy Solutions. ðŸ“ˆ

Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to address real-world challenges and look forward to the future. ðŸš€
