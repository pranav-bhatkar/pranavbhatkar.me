# About Me

Hey! I'm Pranav Bhatkar, a Full Stack Developer from Amravati, Maharashtra. I love building things on the web  whether that's clean UI, robust APIs, or AI-powered features that actually solve problems.

Right now, I'm working at Inagiffy, where I get to work on some really cool web and AI projects. I spend my days writing code in Next.js, NestJS, and React, optimizing backends, fixing tricky bugs, and helping the team build stuff the right way.

## How I Got Here

My journey's been a bit unconventional. I started at PPS Energy Solutions as an office assistant and worked my way up to becoming a developer. During that time, I built their entire office management system  handling everything from attendance to automated reports. I also created Krag.in, an e-commerce platform for SMPS and chargers, which was a great learning experience.

After that, I worked with Axentia on various projects, mixing traditional web apps with AI tools. Now at Inagiffy, I'm focused on building products that actually make a difference.

## What I Work With

**Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** NestJS, Node.js, FastAPI  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, Supabase, Prisma  
**DevOps:** Git, Docker, CI/CD, cloud platforms

I'm also diving into ML and Deep Learning because I think that's where things are headed, and I want to be ready.

## What Drives Me

I care about writing clean code that's easy to maintain and scale. I don't just want things to work  I want them to work well and make sense to the next person who reads them. I also enjoy mentoring and sharing what I've learned along the way.

If you want to talk tech, collaborate on something, or just chat about where software development is going, feel free to reach out!
