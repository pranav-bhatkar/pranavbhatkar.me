Hey there! I'm Pranav Bhatkar, a go-getter from Amravati, Maharashtra. Currently on a break from college, I've been diving into the tech world at PPS Energy Solutions. Started as an office boy, now I'm rocking a desk job, leading three cool projects.

First up, I'm building an office management system for attendance and leaves. Then there's Krag, an e-commerce site selling top-notch SMPS & Chargers. And the cherry on top? An automatic report generator using Next.js, Nest.js, and FastAPI for PPS Energy Solutions.

Oh, and I'm not just about energy – I'm also part of Famocop, a tech biz revolutionizing local shops online. My journey is a mix of tech skills, growth, and a dash of innovation. Excited to see what's next! 👨‍💻✨
