hey all 

i have been in tech for almost 6 years now not professionally but i started yours ago. 

i do alot of things 
- Frontend ✅
- Backend ✅
- Devops ✅
- Linux ✅
- etc 

and i am doing home labing sins past 3 years now mostly to watch shows which i have on my hard drive & to use some useful tools like ntfy, uptime kuma, samba share i have been using this things so much that i can't leave without them but why i am i telling all this crap to you because my long partner of home labing my Raspberry PI 4 B got cooked & its not booting up soooo... it's time to make a new home lab with more powerful machine.

for your knowledge i don't have crazy money so we'll be using an old laptop with 16gb ram & 256SSD i don't wanna dump everything in one post & i also don't have that much time so I'll post weekly every weekend to pe precise. 

first thing we have to do is install an operating system in my case i am using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server why this idk 😐 i just like it & most of the tools & software I'll install on the server only support Ubuntu. that's why

Requirements:
- Old PC Computer or Laptop (that works not dead)
- a USB drive (8GB min)
- keyboard mouse if that doesn't work on your laptop or you have an PC Computer
- if possible use an Ethernet Cable (recommend)


first thing is that you have to download the iso of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS & flash it on to a USB drive so that we can install it on our computer 🖥️ or laptop 💻

then follow the instructions it's very easy if your using a fresh ssd or you don't care if the data get deleted from that ssd in which we install the server 

Instrumental --

and were done installing just click on reboot and unplug the USB drive then login to your server and change some settings on for laptop users 
Keep the laptop on even if lid is closed
