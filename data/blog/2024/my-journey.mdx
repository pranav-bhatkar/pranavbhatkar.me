# Introduction

Greetings, tech enthusiasts! I'm Pranav Bhatkar, and I welcome you to a glimpse of my unconventional journey in the world of technology. From Amravati city of Maharashtra to the dynamic landscapes of the tech industry, my path has been far from traditional. Join me as I recount my experiences, from starting as an office boy to my current role as a Full Stack Developer.

## The Genesis

It all began with a leap of faith. Unsure of my career path after completing my 12th in Amravati, I found myself working at PPS Energy Solutions. Little did I know that this venture would open doors to a diverse and exciting world of technology.

## Rise through the Ranks

Starting as an office boy, my journey took an unexpected turn. Recognizing my technical skills in computers, I swiftly transitioned to a desk job within six months. This marked the beginning of my exploration into various tech domains, setting the stage for the projects that followed.

## Navigating Projects

Currently, I am deeply immersed in three pivotal projects at Famocop. The first involves crafting an efficient office management system, empowering my colleagues to mark attendance and manage leaves seamlessly. The second is the development of 'Krag,' an e-commerce platform specializing in industry-level SMPS and Chargers. Lastly, I am actively engaged in creating an automated report generation system for PPS Energy Solutions, utilizing Next.js for the frontend, Nest.js for the backend, and FastAPI with Redis for report generation and background task handling.

## Lessons Learned

Each project has been a unique chapter, teaching me invaluable lessons about teamwork, problem-solving, and the ever-evolving tech landscape. From the intricacies of e-commerce to the challenges of report automation, every experience has shaped my skills and perspective.

## Join the Odyssey

In the upcoming posts, I'll delve deeper into the technical aspects of these projects, sharing insights, challenges, and lessons learned. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast or someone navigating a unique career path, come aboard as we explore the ever-evolving landscapes of technology together.

Stay tuned for the next leg of the journey!
